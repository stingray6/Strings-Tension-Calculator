# Strings-Tension-Calculator

This program allows users to easily find out the tension on the guitar's neck that the strings produce depending on how they are tuned.
It takes into consideration two main variables: strings' gauge (you can use e.g. light or heavy) and the tuning (a set of notes that implies certain frequencies).

It might come in handy when a guitarist would like to re-tune the instrument without altering too much on how it reacts to playing (typically if you tune down, you need heavier strings - otherwise they would become too loose to sound properly).

The tunings and string sets are pre-defined, so you can just paste desired names of a tuning and a string set into the print functions in the bottom lines.


Features:
- mapping Scientific Pitch Notation to Frequency
- calculating Unit Weight for a given string based upon a force known for the standard tuning (from reference charts)
- calculating Tension for any combination of string set and tuning
